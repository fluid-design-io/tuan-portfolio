First of all, you need to install the TFTP server on your Linux Ubuntu 22.04. You can use the following command to install it:

```bash

sudo apt-get install tftpd-hpa

```

Then, you need to create a folder to store the firmware files. You can use the following command to create a folder named `firmware`:

```bash

sudo mkdir /tftpboot/firmware

```

Then, you need to copy the firmware files to the folder you just created. You can use the following command to copy the firmware files to the folder:

```bash

sudo cp -r /path/to/firmware/files/* /tftpboot/firmware

```

Then, you need to edit the `/etc/default/tftpd-hpa` file. You can use the following command to edit the file:

```bash

sudo nano /etc/default/tftpd-hpa

```

Then, you need to change the `TFTP_DIRECTORY` variable to the folder you just created. You can use the following command to change the variable:

```bash

TFTP_DIRECTORY="/tftpboot/firmware"

```

Then, you need to change the `TFTP_ADDRESS` variable to the IP address of the TFTP server. You can use the following command to change the variable:

```bash

TFTP_ADDRESS=" : "

```

Then, you need to change the `TFTP_OPTIONS` variable to the following:

```bash

TFTP_OPTIONS="--secure --create"

```

Then, you need to restart the TFTP server. You can use the following command to restart the TFTP server:

```bash

sudo systemctl restart tftpd-hpa

```

Then, you need to check if the TFTP server is running. You can use the following command to check if the TFTP server is running:

```bash

sudo systemctl status tftpd-hpa

```

If the TFTP server is running, you should see the following output:

```bash

‚óè tftpd-hpa.service - Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/tftpd-hpa.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Thu 2021-09-09 10:00:00 UTC; 1min 30s ago

```

That's it. You have successfully created a TFTP server on Linux Ubuntu 22.04.
